Finished most of the requirement. Currently my turner has doesn't about face at the end of each 'cycle' and will complete every maze. Will fix the issue and add graphical interface soon. Had fun with this one. 

Code could use some refactoring. I want to spend some time pondering over the actual navigation of the maze. Seems very likely candidate for refactoring.
