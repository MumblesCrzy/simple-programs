## Welcome to My GitHub

You can see here some examples of small projects or challanges I've done. Some of interviews, most to have some fun programming inbetween things.

I've recently decided to commit to the Reddit Daily Programmer challanges with the exception of Sun/Mon.

I'm still figuring out git and it's formatting, so hopefully my repository will grow with more than just more challenges.
